# Changelog

## Release v0.6.1 (2024-12-05)

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1

### Features

The platform's icon API endpoint is not thread safe neither prevent the deletion of icons used by the catalog items ...

So :

* Implement `aria_catalog_item_icon`'s soft deletion (opt-in with `keep_on_destroy = true`)
* Prevent Aria internal errors when manipulating multiple icons by using mutexes on `aria_icon`'s resource CRUD functions

### Fix and enhancements

* Cover `aria_catalog_item_icon` with tests

## Release v0.6.0 (2024-12-04)

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.5.6...v0.6.0

### Major compatibility breaks

* Icons resources are now declared with `path` & (optional) `hash` instead of `content`

### Features

* Add resource `aria_catalog_item_icon`
* Make `aria_icon` compatible with any kind of image

### Fix and enhancements

* Don't store `aria_icon`'s content inside the state (only path & its SHA-256 checksum)

## Release v0.5.6 (2024-12-03)

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.5.5...v0.5.6

### Features

* Implement `aria_orchestrator_action`'s forced deletion (opt-in with `force_delete = true`)
* All resources : Retry deletion upon conflicts error (409's) to try to converge (up to 5 times)

#### Deletion

When deleting a resource, the conflict error (409) is potentially an error that will be solved by the deletion of other resources made in parallel in the same apply.

Ideally, one should declare the dependencies with the `depends_on` or by using attribute's of a resource to configure another. However sometimes its not practical or even not possible (e.g. creating resources with a `for_each` loop). Hence Terraform will execute all delete operations in parallel.

This is why the delete function now retries the delete operation up to 5 times to try to converge to desired state. This is not optimal but at least working for the common use cases.

If this "magic number" of 5 (or the delay) has to be tuned per resource, please open an issue.

### Fix and enhancements

* Document import of resources when available

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2

### Fix and enhancements

* Fix `aria_subscription`'s project scoping: Was scoped to 0 projects instead of being unscoped

## Release v0.5.1 (2024-08-26)

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1

### Fix and enhancements

* Fix UPDATE on `aria_custom_resources` when projectID is empty (by omitting this field on update, crazy POST != full object)

## Release v0.5.0 (2024-08-22)

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0

This is not a major release because its still a v0.x and incrementing to v1 will be done when used
in production for at least few months.

### Major compatibility breaks

* Properties default value: Replace custom state storage encoding format by JSON (see migrations)

### Migrations

You have to manipulate the state and replace default values:

* String: `some text` by `\"some text\"`
* Float: `%!s(float64=10240)` by `10240`
* ... (more jsonencoded values here) ...

Here is the error:

```
│ Error: Invalid JSON String Value
│
│   with aria_custom_resource.redis,
│   on redis.tf line 80, in resource "aria_custom_resource" "redis":
│   80: resource "aria_custom_resource" "redis" {
│
│ A string value was provided that is not valid JSON string format (RFC 7159).
│
│ Given Value: %!s(float64=10240)
╵
```

### Features

* Resource `aria_resource_action`: Make it compatible with custom resources, fix #19

#### Work in progress

* Add work in progress resource `aria_cloud_template_v1`

### Fix and enhancements

* Update `aria_custom_resource` example (doc)
* Merge dependabot requests (terraform plugin testing, resty, ...)
* Fix #61 by replacing propertie's default value custom state storage encoding format with JSON

### Library

#### Features

* Add `AriaClient` in replacement of `AriaClientConfig`
  * Add `Mutex` attribute, used internally by the resources
  * Add `ReadIt` method to deduplicate resources Read methods
  * Add a bunch of other methods
* Library: Add `RWMutexKV` (key/value store for arbitrary read-write mutexes)
* Add `Model` interface with utility methods (declaration) to be able to factorize code

#### Fix and enhancements

* Implement utility methods on models that are exposed as resources
* Refactor resources to use `AriaClient` capabilities

## Release v0.4.1 (2024-07-25)

Diff: https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1

### Fix and enhancements

* Resource `aria_resource_action`: Attribute `criteria` is now normalized with `jsontypes.Normalized`
* Resource `aria_resource_action`: Attribute `form_definition.form` is now normalized with `jsontypes.Normalized`

See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework-jsontypes@v0.1.0/jsontypes#Normalized:

Semantic equality logic is defined for Normalized such that inconsequential differences between JSON strings are ignored (whitespace, property order, etc). If you need strict, byte-for-byte, string equality, consider using ExactType.
