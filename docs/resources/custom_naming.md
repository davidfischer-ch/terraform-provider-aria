  Custom Naming resource
  CAUTION: Updating projects
  See #29 Resource aria_custom_naming manage updating projects properly (scoped mode) https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/issues/29
  If the custon naming is scoped to projects, then updating projects should trigger an update in place and not a replacement. However current version of the provider will plan to replace the resource! The counters will be reset and its probably something not desirable.
  As a workaround, you can update the list of projects in the config and manually on the platform. Then plan to ensure no changes are detected by Terraform.
  Switching from organization <-> projects mode will never be possible without replacing the resource.
  CAUTION: Updating templates
  Updating templates attributes will be shown as updatable in place. The nested template resource will be recreated, including its internal counter.

Custom Naming resource

**CAUTION: Updating projects**

See [#29 Resource aria_custom_naming manage updating projects properly (scoped mode)](https://github.com/davidfischer-ch/terraform-provider-aria/issues/29)

If the custon naming is scoped to projects, then updating projects should trigger an update in place and not a replacement. However current version of the provider will plan to replace the resource! The counters will be reset and its probably something not desirable.

As a workaround, you can update the list of projects in the config and manually on the platform. Then plan to ensure no changes are detected by Terraform.

Switching from organization <-> projects mode will never be possible without replacing the resource.

**CAUTION: Updating templates**

Updating templates attributes will be shown as updatable in place. The nested template resource will be recreated, including its internal counter.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# variables.tf

variable "org_id" {
  type = string
}

# locals.tf

locals {
  pattern = join("-", [
    "$${VM_Common.os_family}",
    "$${VM_Common.vlan}",
    "$${VM_Common.srv_role}",
    "$${#####}" # Counter
  ])
}

resource "aria_custom_naming" "machines" {
  name        = "MachineNaming"
  description = "Standardized naming convention for our machines."

  projects = [
    {
      active       = true
      org_default  = true
      org_id       = var.org_id
      project_id   = "*"
      project_name = "*"
    }
  ]

  templates = {
    "COMPUTE.Machine > Default" = {
      name               = ""
      resource_type      = "COMPUTE"
      resource_type_name = "Machine"
      unique_name        = true
      pattern            = local.pattern
      static_pattern     = ""
      start_counter      = 1
      incrment_step      = 1
    }
    "COMPUTE.Machine > RH-LAB-CACHE" = {
      name               = ""
      resource_type      = "COMPUTE"
      resource_type_name = "Machine"
      unique_name        = true
      pattern            = local.pattern
      static_pattern     = "RH-LAB-CACHE"
      start_counter      = 1
      incrment_step      = 1
    }
    "COMPUTE.Machine > WS-LAB-CACHE" = {
      name               = ""
      resource_type      = "COMPUTE"
      resource_type_name = "Machine"
      unique_name        = true
      pattern            = local.pattern
      static_pattern     = "WS-LAB-CACHE"
      start_counter      = 1
      incrment_step      = 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Describe the resource in few sentences
- `name` (String) A friendly name
- `projects` (Attributes List) Restrict the naming template to given projects (by filters). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--projects))
- `templates` (Attributes Map) Resource naming patterns.
Map key must be set to "resource_type.resource_type_name > static_pattern" for the provider to correlate API with state data.
 See example in documentation for details.
Inspired by https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/terraform-framework-optional-inside-a-setnestedattribute-produces-a-does-not-correlate-with-any-element-in-actual/62974/2. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--templates))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Resource identifier

<a id="nestedatt--projects"></a>
### Nested Schema for `projects`

Required:

- `active` (Boolean) TODO
- `org_default` (Boolean) Default for the organization?
- `org_id` (String) Organization identifier
- `project_id` (String) Projects identifier pattern (e.g. *).
- `project_name` (String) Projects name pattern (e.g. *).

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Resource identifier


<a id="nestedatt--templates"></a>
### Nested Schema for `templates`

Required:

Optional:

- `increment_step` (Number) TODO
- `start_counter` (Number) TODO

Read-Only:
